# skeleton-svelte

This is a skeleton repo that I use for all my freelancing projects. It has `TailwindCSS`, `daisyUI` and `@sveltejs/enhanced-img` configured, which saves a lot of time in the long run.

## Developing
```bash
pnpm run dev
# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building
```bash
pnpm run build
```
To preview the production build,
```bash
pnpm run preview
```
